# Pillager VS Goblin
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
This project is a 2D game that was built with the pygame library. 

### How to play the game
You, the pillager can control the pillager movement with the arrow and space bar keys. 
Use the arrow keys to jump, strafe left and right.
Use the space bar to shoot a bullet at the goblin. 
Successfully shooting the goblin 10 times will kill the goblin and end the game.  
Getting hit by the goblin 2 times will grant the goblin victory and will end the game. 

### Design choice
This game is inspired by the game dungeons and dragons, a classic arcade game which I played for the first time in my college dormitory.
There is a health bar on top of the goblin and the score counter are both ways the player (you) can see how well you are doing in the game quickly. 
The game freezes and pops up with a message "You got hit!" when you are hit by the goblin. 
The character movement is made up of 13 frames each to animate the moving character. 
Each frame of movement has a mild variation in limb and head position to smoothly animate walking and jumping to improve the visual appeal of the game. 
The jump height of the pillager is intentionally very high so that players can jump around the goblin in a patronizing manner. 
I found jumping around the goblin very fun while testing the game!
There is a constant arcade sound loop playing in the background of the game to increase the enjoyability of the game. 
The background of the game is a static image of the hills with a beautiful sky with clouds over it. 


### File structure
The game folder contains the main game script in python, a README.md and a folder of resources to which gives the game its looks.
Within the resource folder contains the goblins and pillagers animations as well as sound effects for bullet shots, hit sound effects and background music. It also contains the background and game over images. 

### Final thoughts
I hope you enjoy my basic but fun little game!
Thank you for reading.
