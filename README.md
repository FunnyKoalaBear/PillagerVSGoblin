# Pillager VS Goblin
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
This project is a 2D game that was built with the pygame library. 

### How to play the game
You, the pillager can control the pillager movement with the arrow and space bar keys. 
Use the arrow keys to jump, strafe left and right.
Use the space bar to shoot a bullet at the goblin. 
Successfully shooting the goblin 10 times will kill the goblin and end the game.  
Getting hit by the goblin 2 times will grant the goblin victory and will end the game. 

### Design choice
This game is inspired by the game dungeons and dragons, a classic arcade game which I played for the first time in my college dormitory.
There is a health bar on top of the goblin and the score counter are both ways the player (you) can see how well you are doing in the game quickly. 
The game freezes and pops up with a message "You got hit!" when you are hit by the goblin. 
The character movement is made up of 13 frames each to animate the moving character. 
Each frame of movement has a mild variation in limb and head position to smoothly animate walking and jumping to improve the visual appeal of the game. 
The jump height of the pillager is intentionally very high so that players can jump around the goblin in a patronizing manner. 
I found jumping around the goblin very fun while testing the game!
There is a constant arcade sound loop playing in the background of the game to increase the enjoyability of the game. 
The background of the game is a static image of the hills with a beautiful sky with clouds over it. 


### File structure
The game folder contains the main game script in python, a README.md and a folder of resources to which gives the game its looks.
Within the resource folder contains the goblins and pillagers animations as well as sound effects for bullet shots, hit sound effects and background music. It also contains the background and game over images. 

### Final thoughts
I hope you enjoy my basic but fun little game!
Thank you for reading. 


# Pillager VS Goblin
#### Video Demo
#### Description
Pillager VS Goblin is a 2D action game built using the Python-based pygame library. It offers a fast-paced, engaging gaming experience where players take on the role of a pillager and must face off against a persistent goblin. With its nostalgic arcade feel, simple mechanics, and visually appealing design, this project was inspired by the classic game "Dungeons and Dragons," a childhood favorite that introduced me to the world of arcade gaming.

### How to Play the Game
As the pillager, your objective is to defeat the goblin by successfully shooting it 10 times with your weapon. You control the pillager’s movements using the arrow keys and space bar:
Arrow Keys:
Move left or right by strafing.
Jump high to avoid the goblin or its attacks.
Space Bar:
Fire bullets at the goblin.

### The game provides clear win or loss conditions:

Victory: Successfully hit the goblin 10 times to deplete its health bar and defeat it.

Defeat: Getting hit by the goblin twice will cause you to lose, ending the game.
The game’s intuitive controls and simple rules make it accessible to players of all skill levels, ensuring a fun and rewarding experience.

### Design Choices
The game’s design reflects a mix of nostalgia and modern arcade elements. Below are some highlights of the design choices:
Visual Appeal
The animations for the pillager and goblin consist of 13 frames each. Every frame introduces subtle variations in limb and head positions, making character movement smooth and realistic. This attention to detail enhances the game’s visual appeal and immerses players in the experience.
The background features a static yet beautifully designed image of hills beneath a vibrant sky filled with clouds. This serene landscape contrasts with the intensity of the gameplay, creating a balanced aesthetic.
Player Feedback
A health bar displayed above the goblin provides real-time feedback on its remaining health, allowing players to gauge their progress effectively.
A score counter tracks successful hits on the goblin, encouraging players to aim for victory.
When the player gets hit by the goblin, the game momentarily freezes and displays a message: “You got hit!” This pause not only grabs the player’s attention but also builds suspense.

### Gameplay Mechanics
The pillager’s jump height is intentionally exaggerated. This allows players to leap over the goblin and its attacks in a playful and sometimes patronizing manner. During testing, I found this aspect particularly enjoyable, as it added a layer of fun to the overall gameplay.
A constant arcade sound loop plays in the background, reinforcing the game’s retro-inspired design. This audio element enhances immersion and keeps the player engaged throughout.
Classic Inspiration
The game draws significant inspiration from the arcade game "Dungeons and Dragons," which I first encountered in my college dormitory. The simplistic yet challenging gameplay of that classic influenced many aspects of this project, from its mechanics to its visual and audio design.

### File Structure
The project’s files are organized into a logical and accessible structure to ensure ease of understanding and modification. The main components are as follows:
Main Game Script
The primary Python script that drives the game’s mechanics, rendering, and logic.
README.md
A detailed document explaining the game’s setup, requirements, and gameplay instructions. This file serves as a guide for anyone looking to run or modify the game.

### Resources Folder
This folder contains all the assets needed for the game’s visuals and audio. Inside, you’ll find:
Animations:
Individual frames for the pillager and goblin movements.
Sound Effects:
Bullet shooting sounds.
Goblin hit sound effects.
Background music loop.
Images:
The static background image of hills and sky.
Game-over screens and other graphical elements.
This modular structure ensures that contributors and users can easily navigate the project and customize it to their preferences.

### Final Thoughts
Creating Pillager VS Goblin has been a rewarding experience that allowed me to explore and combine my passion for programming and arcade gaming. The process involved crafting a game that is both challenging and entertaining while paying homage to the classic games that shaped my love for the medium.
I’ve thoroughly enjoyed designing the high-jumping mechanics, fluid animations, and engaging gameplay loop. During testing, I found immense satisfaction in jumping around the goblin and devising ways to outmaneuver it, a testament to the game’s fun and replayable nature.
While the game is simple, it’s designed to be a lighthearted and enjoyable experience for players of all ages. Whether you’re a seasoned gamer or someone looking for a quick and fun challenge, I hope Pillager VS Goblin brings you as much joy as it brought me during its creation.
Thank you for taking the time to read about my project. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed creating it!
